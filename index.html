        <strong>Overview</strong>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in App for iOS.</p>
        <strong>Information We May Collect</strong>
        <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you during your use of our apps, unless you choose to share it with us via a “Feedback” option, as described in the appropriate sections below.</p>
        <p>Individual settings relating to the apps are not personal and are stored only on your device. You might also be asked to provide access to your photo library, but this is only so you can open your photos in App and save them back to your library. We don’t process that information at all and have no access to it.</p>
        <p>In addition, if you take a photo using App for iOS, camera metadata is saved in the image, but we have no access to that data and it is not shared with anyone unless you yourself choose to share the image.</p>
        <strong>Feedback</strong>
        <p>Our app may provide an option called "Feedback" that you can use to inform us of any bugs you observe, provide criticism, or simply share your thoughts with us. If you use this option, we ask for your email address so that we have a way to respond. You can optionally give us your name and a description of the issue you want to report.</p>
        <strong>Our Applications Comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
        <p>Our applications don’t collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>
